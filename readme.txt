Ab insomni custodita dracone. Stops fake sign-ups without captchas, feeds bots a fake success and keeps evidence for abuse reports.

== Description ==

Bots that create fake accounts usually post straight to the registration endpoint, ask for roles that do not exist, fill every field they see and come from rented servers. Draco Insomnis scores every public sign-up on those signs before the account exists.

* **No captcha.** People never solve puzzles. A hidden trap field and a signed page stamp do the work.
* **Bots are fooled, not warned.** A bot is told "registration complete" after a short, capped wait. No account is created.
* **Doubtful is not guilty.** One weak sign alone (a VPN, an odd username) never rejects a person.
* **Evidence for abuse reports.** Every suspicious attempt is kept for 90 days and can be downloaded per address as a CSV file to send to the network provider.
* **Automatic blocks.** Three bot attempts in a day block the address for a week. Administrators' recent addresses are never blocked.
* **Defence only.** Nothing is ever sent back to the attacker's machine.
* **Not security by obscurity.** Field names and the stamp key are unique to each site, so reading this code does not tell a bot what to send.

Protects the registration forms of WordPress, WooCommerce and the RealHomes theme.

= Site mail (SMTP) =

Sends the mail of the site through a real mailbox instead of PHP mail(), so login codes, forms and orders actually arrive.

* **Test before it counts.** Nothing changes until a test message succeeds; changing any setting switches it off until you test again.
* **Encrypted password.** Stored with AES-256-GCM using a key from the site's own security keys.
* **Ready-made settings** for Hostinger, IONOS, OVHcloud, Arsys, GoDaddy, Zoho, Microsoft 365, Google, Brevo, Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark, Mailjet, Amazon SES and more.
* **Deliverability checks.** Warns when the sender is not on the site's domain or when the domain's DMARC policy will reject PHP mail().
* **Sender that passes DMARC.** The mailbox becomes the visible sender; the original address goes to Reply-To.
* **Log of the last 50 messages** (never their content) and extra addresses for WordPress recovery and password-change alerts.

More modules are on the way: firewall, two-step login by e-mail, and confirmation of forms and new accounts by e-mail.

= Who makes it =

Draco Insomnis is made by [Notorius Vision](https://notoriusvision.com), the team behind [OPNV Systems](https://opnv.systems) and OPNV SOLΞ. It is the open-source security core of OPNV.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Open **Draco Insomnis → Anti-bot shield** and tick **Protect sign-ups**.
3. Open **Draco Insomnis → Site mail (SMTP)**: connect your mailbox, send a test, then switch it on.
4. If the site is behind Cloudflare or another proxy, choose the matching **Visitor address** option and check that "Your address as the plugin sees it" shows your real address.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will real people be rejected? =

Only if they send a sign that people never send, such as a role the form does not offer or a value in the invisible trap field. People with JavaScript turned off or on a VPN are only marked "doubtful" and go through.

= Does it slow the site down? =

Only bots wait, for at most three seconds, and at most ten slow answers per minute across the whole site.

= What does it store? =

For suspicious attempts only: date, address, browser name, username, e-mail, requested role and referring page. Never passwords. Everything is deleted after 90 days, and all of it is removed when the plugin is deleted.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
* First version: anti-bot shield for sign-ups and site mail (SMTP).
