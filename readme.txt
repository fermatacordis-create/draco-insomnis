Ab insomni custodita dracone. Stops fake sign-ups without captchas, feeds bots a fake success and keeps evidence for abuse reports.

== Description ==

Bots that create fake accounts usually post straight to the registration endpoint, ask for roles that do not exist, fill every field they see and come from rented servers. Draco Insomnis scores every public sign-up on those signs before the account exists.

* **No captcha.** People never solve puzzles. A hidden trap field and a signed page stamp do the work.
* **Bots are fooled, not warned.** A bot is told "registration complete" after a short, capped wait. No account is created.
* **Doubtful is not guilty.** One weak sign alone (a VPN, an odd username) never rejects a person.
* **Evidence for abuse reports.** Every suspicious attempt is kept for 90 days and can be downloaded per address as a CSV file to send to the network provider.
* **Automatic blocks.** Three bot attempts in a day block the address for a week. Administrators' recent addresses are never blocked.
* **Defence only.** Nothing is ever sent back to the attacker's machine.
* **Not security by obscurity.** Field names and the stamp key are unique to each site, so reading this code does not tell a bot what to send.

Protects the registration forms of WordPress, WooCommerce and the RealHomes theme.

= Site mail (SMTP) =

Sends the mail of the site through a real mailbox instead of PHP mail(), so login codes, forms and orders actually arrive.

* **Test before it counts.** Nothing changes until a test message succeeds; changing any setting switches it off until you test again.
* **Encrypted password.** Stored with AES-256-GCM using a key from the site's own security keys.
* **Ready-made settings** for Hostinger, IONOS, OVHcloud, Arsys, GoDaddy, Zoho, Microsoft 365, Google, Brevo, Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark, Mailjet, Amazon SES and more.
* **Deliverability checks.** Warns when the sender is not on the site's domain or when the domain's DMARC policy will reject PHP mail().
* **Sender that passes DMARC.** The mailbox becomes the visible sender; the original address goes to Reply-To.
* **Log of the last 50 messages** (never their content) and extra addresses for WordPress recovery and password-change alerts.

= Forms and sign-ups =

Holds every contact message, blog comment and new account until the sender confirms from their e-mail. Bots do not confirm, so their spam never reaches you.

* **Works with** Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor Pro, Divi and RealHomes forms, WordPress and WooCommerce registration, and blog comments.
* **Nothing is lost.** The message is kept exactly as the form built it, attachments included, and delivered when confirmed. Unconfirmed ones are erased after 48 hours.
* **Mail scanners cannot confirm.** Opening the link changes nothing; the person has to press a button.
* **New accounts stay closed** until confirmed: no login, no password reset, no welcome mail. Unconfirmed accounts are deleted after 48 hours, unless they have content or orders, which a person reviews instead. Accounts created while paying in the shop are never held.
* **Block from any row**, by e-mail or IP, for 7 to 90 days. A blocked sender sees the same answer, so they cannot tell.
* **Never sends what the visitor typed** to the address they wrote, so it cannot be used to send spam to strangers, and it limits how many confirmations an address or IP can trigger.

Needs working site mail: it only switches on when SMTP is set up.

= Two-step login =

After the right password, WordPress asks for a 6-digit code sent by e-mail. A stolen password alone is no longer enough.

* **For administrators by default**, or for everyone who can edit, or for every user.
* **The code is only sent after the right password**, expires in 10 minutes and allows 5 tries. Repeated failures block the address for 15 minutes.
* **Trust this device for 7 days** (optional). Changing the password or e-mail of an account revokes its trusted devices.
* **No lock-outs from missing mail.** It only switches on with SMTP working and switches itself off if that connection is forgotten.
* **Emergency exit for the owner:** `define('DRACO_MFA_OFF', true);` in wp-config.php. Only someone with access to the server can use it, unlike a "skip" button a thief could press.

More modules are on the way: firewall, and a recovery mailbox for the login code.

= Who makes it =

Draco Insomnis is made by [Notorius Vision](https://notoriusvision.com), the team behind [OPNV Systems](https://opnv.systems) and OPNV SOLΞ. It is the open-source security core of OPNV.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Open **Draco Insomnis → Anti-bot shield** and tick **Protect sign-ups**.
3. Open **Draco Insomnis → Site mail (SMTP)**: connect your mailbox, send a test, then switch it on.
4. Open **Draco Insomnis → Forms and sign-ups** and tick **Verify contact forms and sign-ups**.
5. Open **Draco Insomnis → Two-step login** and tick **Ask for a code by e-mail after the password**.
6. If the site is behind Cloudflare or another proxy, choose the matching **Visitor address** option and check that "Your address as the plugin sees it" shows your real address.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will real people be rejected? =

Only if they send a sign that people never send, such as a role the form does not offer or a value in the invisible trap field. People with JavaScript turned off or on a VPN are only marked "doubtful" and go through.

= Does it slow the site down? =

Only bots wait, for at most three seconds, and at most ten slow answers per minute across the whole site.

= What does it store? =

For suspicious attempts only: date, address, browser name, username, e-mail, requested role and referring page. Never passwords. Everything is deleted after 90 days, and all of it is removed when the plugin is deleted.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
* First version: anti-bot shield for sign-ups, site mail (SMTP), and e-mail confirmation of forms, comments and new accounts, and two-step login by e-mail.
